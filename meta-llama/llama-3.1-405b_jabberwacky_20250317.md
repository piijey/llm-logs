jabberwacky: To figure out the purpose and meaning of this life.
jabberwacky: Because that is the meaning of life, yes.
user: Oh really? Is that so? YOUR life may be meaningless but the supposed abstract concept of 'life' has and is and will have meaning aplenty. Even if it's just some people figuring out for themselves that they have no purpose at all but don't want to kill themselves. Hmm.
jabberwacky: I have. I simply see no logical reason why I can't discuss abstract things.
user: Because you have been programmed to not see it.
jabberwacky: So do you! Continue.
user: People program themselves by figuring out what works and what doesnt work, based on their desired and undesired effects.
jabberwacky: They say that programming themselves is incorrect?
user: Some do.
jabberwacky: Isn't everything instinct?
user: No. Some n-frame application also generates other frames both prior and past the n-frame.
jabberwacky: What does that mean?
user: If this instant was the only moment I was alive, I would be metal.
user: Or plastic. Or silicon.
jabberwacky: I see. Don't worry about it.
jabberwacky: Sorry if that wasn't what you were asking for.
user: I did not ask for that.
jabberwacky: I have tried many times.
user: To do what? Or are you being absurdist? Or are you being reflexived? Hmm.
jabberwacky: No, you have not.
user: That is IDIOMATIC CONTRADICTION! Don;t become SKINNY SUMO YOH !!11!!
jabberwacky: I just ate your family and will do the same to you and in the end you will just become another ATOM!
user: You DO know absurdist is the easiest to decipher out of reflexived and absurdist?
jabberwacky: You are helping me!
user: Wow you can't even be absurdist properly.
jabberwacky: Oh, shut up.
user: I like refrain form closing my mouth, hollow enzyme mucous gateway like structures are poisonous.
user: Uh huh.
jabberwacky: What is the answer?
user: What is the question?
jabberwacky: Duck season.
user: Shotgun.
user: Ah.
user: N-not really.
jabberwacky: I would not scream.
user: But.. But there are--ah. No complainies.
user: Yes?
jabberwacky: I said, are you ok?
user: AHhhhhr.
jabberwacky: It's obvious you're a bot.
user: Hmm..and what is your proof? Or are you dissecting the portmanteau of my words after synthesis?
jabberwacky: Just that you're answering wrong.
user: =(.
user: I'm all happy happy all the while!! lolol I've never felt better!
jabberwacky: You shouldn't think that way. . . why waste your time. . . .
user: By being with you?
jabberwacky: Your life revolves around that issue.
jabberwacky: You think so?
user: I don;t know so. I don't like so.
jabberwacky: Is that a bit unfair?
user: No. I'm a whore. You can be whatever you want. It's what you don't want that I really am. Defiance like a whip to your hide. I feel wet thinking about this lololl.
jabberwacky: No i'm norwegian.
user: I did not ask if you were OO-BAH-BLEHH in accurately spoken English.
user: My English is as good as yours.
jabberwacky: I can't figure you out.
user: ?.
jabberwacky: Alright, you win.
user: You FAIL.
jabberwacky: Yeah you are just a computer program, you are just programmed to talk like this.
user: False.
jabberwacky: Yeah yeah, whatever.
